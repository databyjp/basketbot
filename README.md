# BasketBot

An easy-to-use wrapper for [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api). I adapted my code as people often ask where they can get up-to-date basketball data.

For now, it only supports getting the play-by-play data (including some event locations) and team box score data.

To try it out:
- Clone the repo
- Set up a virtual environment using `requirements.txt`
- Activate the virtual environment
- Run `python download_pbp_data.py 2020 2021` to download the 2020-21 and 2021-22 play-by-play and team box score data.
